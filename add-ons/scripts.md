Scripts are standalone programs that can interact with stash either through graphql queries, custom Javascript or by directly editing Stash database/files.

To install a script follow the script's install instructions.

Scripts are separated into 2 sections [Official](#official) and [Third-party](#third-party).

## Official

Official scripts are hosted on [CommunityScripts repository](https://github.com/stashapp/CommunityScripts){:target="_blank"}. All code is reviewed by core Stash team and any questions or issues you have regarding these scripts can be raised in Discord or GitHub.
