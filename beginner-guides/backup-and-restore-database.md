# Backup

Always use the UI to create a backup of the DB. As with all live databases **DO NOT** copy manually the database file as a means of backup.
The `Backup` or `Download Backup` tasks are the proper way to create a backup file.

Stash uses an sqlite database with `WAL` mode enabled. This practically means that along with the main db file `stash.go-sqlite` there can be a `-shm` and a `-wal` file present ([more info](https://sqlite.org/wal.html){:target="_blank"}). Even stopping Stash might leave some of these index files present so again **DO NOT** manually copy the database file.

# Restore

Assuming you have properly created a backup file you can use it to restore your database if needed.
For the location of the db file check your configuration's `Database Path`.
The restore procedure uses the default `stash-go.sqlite` filename, if you changed that when configuring stash adjust accordingly.

The following steps are recommended when restoring a database file.

1. Create a backup of the current database (Optional)
1. Stop stash
1. Move or delete the `stash-go.sqlite` database file (along with the `-shm` `-wal` `.journal` files if present)
1. Copy the backup file that you want to restore to `stash-go.sqlite`
1. Make sure that you now have a `stash-go.sqlite` file and that no `-shm` `-wal` `.journal` files are present. 
1. Start stash

You should now have stash running with a working and restored database.

# Advanced Troubleshooting

If you get a database malformed message during upgrade or backup that probably means that the database is already corrupt. One way to get past that is to do a full export and check the error log. If there are not a lot of errors you can then try to do a full import and get a working db with minimal losses. As the full import is destructive proceed with caution.
