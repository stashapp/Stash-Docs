---

There are several ways to get metadata into Stash. Choose a type based on how much automation, coverage, and control you need.

You can configure your metadata sources under :fontawesome-solid-gear: **Settings** > **Metadata Providers**. See sections below for more details. 

## Types

### [Stash-box instances](/metadata-sources/stash-box-instances)

Stash-box instances provides automated or semi-automated tagging of scenes, performers and studios by matching fingerprints, StashIDs or names. The endpoint and API key are available on your stash-box account page.

Good for broad coverage and community-maintained tags. 

### [Scrapers](/metadata-sources/scrapers)

Scrapers are built-in method to fetch metadata from wide-ranging external sources (databases, studio websites or any other website).

Best when you need source-specific accuracy or official studio metadata.
