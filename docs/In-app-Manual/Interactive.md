Stash currently supports syncing with Handy devices, using funscript files.

In order for stash to connect to your Handy device, the Handy Connection Key must be entered in Settings -> Interface.

Funscript files must be in the same directory as the matching video file and must have the same base name. For example, a funscript file for `video.mp4` must be named `video.funscript`. A scan must be run to update scenes with matching funscript files.

Scenes with funscript files can be filtered with the `interactive` criterion.
