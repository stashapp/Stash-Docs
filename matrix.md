# What is Matrix?

Matrix is an open-source internet protocol for secure, decentralised, real-time communication. Unlike other popular platforms like Discord, Matrix is federated. It consists of many servers, each server hosts Matrix accounts and chats. You can create an account on any Matrix server and the join other servers without having to re-create your account. One common example of federated protocol everyone uses today is email. 

On Matrix, usernames are referred to as MXIDs (Matrix IDs), chats as rooms, servers as homeservers. Think of homeserver as the domain that hosts the instance. You can also group rooms together to form spaces (similar to Discord server). 

In comparison to Discord:<br />
Username = Matrix ID<br />
Channel = Room<br />
Server = Space<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Spaces are a collection of individual rooms.

# Registration on Matrix

There is no central place to register on. You can create an account on any homeserver and join spaces and rooms across all of them. 

## Popular homeservers

- [matrix.org (click to create an account)<sup>2</sup>](https://app.element.io/#/register){:target="_blank"}
- [nitro.chat (click to create an account)](https://app.nitro.chat/#/register){:target="_blank"}
- [matrix.im (click to create an account)](https://element.matrix.im/#/register){:target="_blank"}

## Clients

{: .note}
Web-based clients are great to start and register. Element (web) is feature-rich and easy to use client. 

Matrix supports a variety of clients on web, desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and mobile (Android, iOS). matrix.org maintains a list of clients on their website [here](https://matrix.org/clients/){:target="_blank"}.

# Stash space

{: .important }
Rooms can be joined from inside the space. You can join one, or more rooms, or all rooms from the space. They are not directly tied to each other.

Our official space is located at [#stashapp:unredacted.org](https://matrix.to/#/#stashapp:unredacted.org){:target="_blank"}.  
Alternative addresses are on matrix.im: [#stashapp:matrix.im](https://matrix.to/#/#stashapp:matrix.im){:target="_blank"}.

# Stash rooms

{: .important }
We are using a bridge bot that relays Discord and Matrix messages both ways in some rooms. They will be marked (bridged). Some features doesn't translate through the bridge like reactions and threads.

{: .note }
Some rooms are designated as [NSFW]. Adult focused media is allowed to be posted in those rooms without /spoiler as long as they within space rules.
