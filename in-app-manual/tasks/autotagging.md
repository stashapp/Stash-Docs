This task matches your Performers, Studios, and Tags against your media, based on names only. It finds Scenes, Images, and Galleries where the path or filename contains the Performer/Studio/Tag. 

For each scene it finds that matches, it sets the applicable field. It will **only** tag based on performers, studios, and tags that already exist in your database.

When the Performer/Studio/Tag name has multiple words, the search will include paths/filenames where the Performer/Studio/Tag name is separated with `.`, `-` or `_` characters, as well as whitespace.

For example, auto tagging for performer `Jane Doe` will match the following filenames:
* `Jane.Doe.1.mp4`
* `Jane_Doe.2.mp4`
* `Jane-Doe.3.mp4`
* `Jane Doe.4.mp4`

Matching is case insensitive, and should only match exact wording within word boundaries. For example, `Jane Doe` will not match `Maryjane-Doe`, but will match `Mary-Jane-Doe`.

Auto tagging for only specific Performers, Studios and Tags can be performed from the individual Performer/Studio/Tag page.
